Progress Report

Agenda
	•	Feedback from mentor 
	•	Logistic question 
		- Can we put all pdf’s in a folder? 
	•	Backend 
		- Certificate authentication: how to securely put keys? 
	•	Frontend 
		- Menu bar on the left: should we have separate html pages or is hiding and showing div ok? 
		- Where should html files go? public, public/html, or views? 
		- Do we need front end tests? Or should people who only do front end also do backend tests? 

Meeting Minutes
	•	Logistics

		- Next meeting will be wednesday 2:30

		- This Wednesday 2:30 demo to TA

	•	Backend

		- Very bad idea to use mit certificate

		- @mit.edu authentication combined with people directory

	•	Frontend

		- Pastel color recommended, blue green, avoid dark background

		- Menu bar on the left: should we have separate html pages or is hiding and showing div ok? - doesn’t really matter, but avoid copying navbar

		- Where should html files go? public, public/html, or views? - Express needs to be in views; using handlebars can just be in public

	•	Testing

		- Don’t need frontend test, it’d be cool if we could - mainly test frontend functions and logics. Make sure everything else is tested. Recommend doing tests now.

		- Write tests for the code you’re responsible for.
